# CRCBiomarkers

## Overview
These codes were developed for the scientific paper titled 'Identifying novel diagnostic gene biomarkers for colorectal cancer through bioinformatics analysis and machine learning,' including a demo of the results. Unauthorized use of this code for any other purpose is prohibited. The repository contains R codes designed for the identification of diagnostic biomarkers using bioinformatics analysis and machine learning methods.

The files are organised into four folders:
* _Data_: which contains all the transcriptomic data required to perform the analyses described in the paper
* _Codes_: contains the R code to reproduce all  analyses.
* _Results_: contains all the results produced by the R scripts.



## Required software
The scripts use core R functionality and several publicly available R packages listed below. Version numbers in brackets correspond to the versions of the packages that were used to develop and debug these scripts.

 - R (4.3.1)
 - RStudio (2022.07.2+576): Optional, testing functions and running the code step-by-step.
 -
